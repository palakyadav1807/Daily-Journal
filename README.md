### To run this app in your PC, follow these steps:
To get started, you have to [fork](https://github.com/palakyadav1807/Daily-Journal/fork) this repo to your own GitHub account first. Then open up a terminal on your machine and enter the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/Daily-Journal.git
cd Daily-Journal
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. This page should reload automatically when you make changes to the code, but no code is perfect, so sometimes you may need to restart it. :)
